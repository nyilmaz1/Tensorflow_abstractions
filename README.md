# Tensorflow_abstractions

Tensorflow has many abstractions, like TF Learn, Keras, TF-Slim, Layers, Estimator API and more. These higher level APIs allow you to simplify your code in order to still call the same sort of tensorflow commands.   
The most common abstractions used:  
Estimator API  
Keras  
Layers  

To compare various abstractions we'll use a dataset available from SciKit Learn library. The data is comprised of the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are 13 different measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of wine. We will use various TF abstractions to classify the wine to one of the 3 possible labels
